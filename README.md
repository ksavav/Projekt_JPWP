# Scrabble

This project is my vision of the popular board game called "Scrabble".

This game was writen in C# language using .NET repository.
Code contains 7 classes, 2 windows Forms and sorce files (dictionary, backgroud pictures, button etc.)

The game starts with menu window were players can chose their names:

After inserting names and pressing "Zaczynamy!" button, this window will be closed and new window will pop up:
